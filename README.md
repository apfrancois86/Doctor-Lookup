# Doctor Lookup

### Created by Alex Francois


## Description
This is a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “toothache”) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors they may seek out to help with their medical issue.


## Setup
Clone directory, run "npm install" and 'bower install'. Visit the BetterDoctors API site (https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) and click “Get a free API key”. Fill out the form, or authenticate with GitHub. Your API key should be listed on the front page (ex: “a2c356ibgh44…..”) or under My Account > Applications. Place your key in an .env file at the top level of your directory. Name your API key variable 'exports.apiKey= "YOUR API KEY" '. Edit HTML, CSS, and JS files as needed. To display in browser run "gulp build" and then "gulp serve".
